## 🔍 Overview

The Automated Index Recommendation System is designed to tackle the challenge of database performance optimization. As databases grow in size and complexity, maintaining optimal performance becomes increasingly difficult. This system provides an intelligent solution by continuously analyzing query patterns and recommending appropriate indexes to enhance database performance.

Key benefits include:
- Automated identification of potential performance bottlenecks
- Data-driven index recommendations based on actual query patterns
- Quantitative assessment of potential performance improvements
- Intuitive visualization of database performance metrics
- Reduced manual effort in database optimization
- Improved application response times through optimized query execution

## ✨ Features

- Query execution time measurement
- Historical query pattern analysis

### 🔹 IndexRecommender
- Analysis of query patterns to identify index candidates
- Advanced scoring algorithms to prioritize recommendations
- Generation of precise CREATE INDEX statements
- Estimation of potential performance improvements

### 🔹 PerformanceComparer
- Side-by-side comparison of query performance with and without indexes
- Temporary index creation for testing
- Detailed metrics on execution time improvements
- Percentage-based improvement calculations

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- SQLite 3
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/index-recommendation-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd index-recommendation-system
   ```

3. Install required dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure database connection in `config.ini` (default configuration is included)

## 💻 Usage

### Starting the Application
Run `python app.py` to launch the web server. The application will be accessible through your web browser.

### Query Analysis
1. Navigate to the Query Editor page
2. Enter your SQL query in the editor
3. Click "Run Query" to execute
4. View execution results, statistics, and execution plan

### Index Recommendations
1. Navigate to the Index Recommendations page
2. Review the system's recommendations sorted by impact score
3. Filter recommendations by table or impact level
4. Click "Apply" to implement a recommended index
5. View performance improvement metrics

### Performance Monitoring
1. Navigate to the Performance Metrics page
2. View performance charts and statistics
3. Toggle between different time periods (day/week/month)
4. Analyze index impact on query performance

## 📊 Dashboard & UI

The system features a modern, intuitive user interface built with:
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Interactive data visualizations using Chart.js
- Real-time performance metrics
- Filter and sorting capabilities for all data tables
- Dark/light mode for user preference

The dashboard provides at-a-glance visibility into:
- Total indexes in use
- Tables analyzed
- Pending recommendations
- Performance improvement percentages
- Database size metrics
- Memory usage statistics
- Cache hit ratio
- Average query execution time

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system is highly configurable through the `config.ini` file:

```ini
[DATABASE]
db_file = index_recommendation.db
backup_directory = backups

[UI]
theme = default
table_format = grid
show_execution_plan = ask
max_results = 100

[ANALYSIS]
min_index_score = 0.5
consider_query_frequency = true
log_retention_days = 30
comparison_iterations = 3

[EXPORT]
export_directory = exports
export_format = csv
```

Additional settings can be adjusted through the Settings page in the web interface.
